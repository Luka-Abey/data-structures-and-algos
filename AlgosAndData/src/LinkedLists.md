The order of a linked list is not given by its physical placement in memory. It is given by the current element and its reference to the next element.

Split into two instantiations : singly and doubly linked lists. Single is one-way, as each node refers to a single, 'next' node. Double is two ways, with references stored for next and previous nodes. The java.util.LinkedList<E> is a doubly-linked list implementation.
