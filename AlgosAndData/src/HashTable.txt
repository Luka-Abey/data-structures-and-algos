Hash tables are arrays where we translate and assign values to an index.

Key -> (Hash) Function -> Hash code (index)
The function is, more often than not, a modulo operator with value.

What if we have two keys,
3, and 13, and our function is X mod 5...
Hash code for both would be 3..
This is known as a collision

How do we deal with collisions?
