A tree whose elements have no more than two children - the left and right child.

Nodes at certain points on a binary tree can contain 1) data 2) pointer to left child 3) pointer to right child.

There is also a root pointer for the highest node in the tree.

Stanford says binary trees have an elegant recursive pointer structure
